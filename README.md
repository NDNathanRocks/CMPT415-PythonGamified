Excited to introduce our latest project â€“ a dynamic ReactJS app with Firebase Database integration, revolutionizing Python learning. Together with Professor Hazra Imran from SFU and Alyssa, we embarked on a journey to redefine education.

Our platform features seamless Judge0 API integration for instant code evaluation, reducing frustrations and enhancing learning efficiency. Additionally, the introduction of a spirited leaderboard system fosters healthy competition, driving user participation and motivation.

Despite challenges in inheriting existing code, our collaboration proved invaluable, strengthening bonds and honing skills in software maintenance and teamwork. Grateful for this enriching experience, I eagerly anticipate future innovations and growth opportunities in technology-driven education.
